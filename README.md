# Crime-Predictor-Project
Summer Project with a focus on AI predicting Crime.

Writing this June 2nd of 2025. I've decided to try and build my own summer project
revolving around the premise of AI prediction based on the machine lerning lessons
I've learnt. I'll be using Jupyter Notebook as the main classifcation workshop while
using VS Code as my IDE. Will plan on updating further in the future.
